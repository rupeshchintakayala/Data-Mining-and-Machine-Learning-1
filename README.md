This project provides a fundamental analysis of the cost of commuting for an average income person in New York City.

Module: H9DMML1 - Data Mining and Machine Learning 1

### Overview
When the COVID-19 shutdown happened across the world, many industries lost their position in the market and one of them was the taxi industry as all the commuters were working from home, no tourists and other businesses were also shut down. When cities started recovering from the pandemic, the immense rise in demand for taxis to commute for everyday work has created a huge gap between the demand and supply of the taxis and passengers. The taxi industry was not ready to meet the demand of the commuters for daily life, in turn rising the base fares for taxi rides making the average-income population hard to afford. This raises the question of either buying a used car or using a taxi to commute. The objective of this project is to improve the accuracy of prediction of the taxi trip cost, price of a used car, and salary of different individuals from one of the busiest cities across the world i.e., New York using the KDD methodology by making use of Python, PostgreSQL and draw essential insights that could help to acknowledge the problem and get to conclusions to address the problem.
